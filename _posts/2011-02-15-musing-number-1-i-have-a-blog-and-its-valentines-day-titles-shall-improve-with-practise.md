So, apparently, I have a blog. A sort-of-gift from my darling after mentioning in passing that facebook statuses were not enough to convey the true depths of my insight. I didn't actually say that that at all, but it's totally what I meant. And so I am now able to waffle on, and maybe sometimes hit upon something interesting.

It is, as is obvious from the date, the day after Valentine's. I write still all loved up and glowing. I've never had a proper Valentine before (i.e. one that wasn't forced by his mother to return a card. I hope) and so was justly excited at the prospect of sharing the day with a truly loved one. My mood was only somewhat dented by the anti-sentimental sentiment all over facebook when I logged in.

Don't think for a second that I believe that you can't be happy and single. Don't think that you can't enjoy Valentine's without a boy- and/or girlfriend. But don't rain on my parade when I'm giddy on love and want to celebrate on a day set aside for it.

One friend said (and I paraphrase) that if you love someone, it's not just for one day but everyday. Which is completely true. But I never suggested that it was just for a day. It's just that this is the only time of year when you can buy heart-shaped brownies and LED kits, and chocolates that are so beautiful you can't bring yourself to eat them. Allow couples a day to be publicly nauseating without being judged, yeah?

(This) rant over.
