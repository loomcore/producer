And I don't really see either one of those as better than the other.

Now, bear with me; this has been a bone of contention for a long time.

I am many things. That is, I am not one thing. I cannot be defined in one single word or phrase, and nor can anyone else. Don’t get me wrong, we need these shortcuts to understanding people, to knowing whether it is someone with whom we shall get on; that’s how these labels develop. I use them myself.

But problems arise. When I was a bit evangelical, I referred to myself as such, and that was the role I played for many years. It coloured the way I talked to people, and the way they talked to me. In fact, it still does: my friends of old are astounded that I’m in a ‘physical’ relationship. So when I became an atheist, I chose to avoid all the baggage of a label and so do not define myself solely as that. Nor as a woman, a brunette, a 20-year-old, a pacifist, a Cantabrigian, a Welshwoman, a European, a writer, a Penn and Teller fan, a sceptic. I’m all of these things all at once because I am a person, a human being. That is the only word that I would like to use.

And so to my main rant. I am an art historian. This is another one of my labels, which lumps me into the ‘arts’ half of the subject divide that I didn’t know existed until last year. There is, apparently, a fundamental difference in the personalities of the members of my university that rests exclusively on their choice of degree. This is not a view held by everyone I know (far from it, in honesty), but it is an assumption I have met lots more times than I’d like.

This comes mostly from arts students themselves, who either feign ignorance and need to be rescued by those who understand such technical matters as installing printers; or, worse, they alone claim to be creative and driven by their emotions (something, supposedly, to be admired) and interesting. The other half, the scientists (hiss, boo etc.) are then either regarded with disdain or used simply to make life easier (“fix my computer” etc.). Worse even than that is when a fellow arts student tries to encourage you to ‘stick together’ against the unfathomable ramblings of the scientists (like when they talk about numbers and graphs and stuff), or to try to excuse a lack of enthusiasm about a topic with statements like “Oh, we don’t know, we’re arts students” and then leave it at that. I can count and read and have a profound interest in the whole world around me. I would like to know everything, please. Including subjects outside of my degree. If I don’t know it, teach me.

Let’s start with one significant point: I chose my degree largely at random: as with many of my most important life decisions, I went with what sounded like a good idea at the time. I had never considered being an art historian prior to scanning the list of subjects available. And I have always been equally good at arts and sciences; for most of my life, the latter was of much more interest to me.

Secondly, why do we assume that just because one has chosen to study a particular discipline, they are of a particular personality type? I am nothing like the stereotype of the art students (I hope). I do not own a granddad jumper, nor thick plastic specs, and I do not swan about affectedly and I try my best not to dramatise every trivial event of my life. That’s unfair. I generalise. But I know that you, beloved reader, have an image in your head of such a student. I am not that student. I’m just me.

Now I’ve defended the scientists up to this point, but it isn’t just the artists that act upon these assumptions. One of the things that most bothers me is the way, sometimes, that my scientific counterparts slow their tone and go back and explain the most basic concepts, assuming that because I have chosen to study art, I have forgotten GCSE Science. (I haven’t. Well, not all of it.) Or assume that I’m not doing a real degree/it’s easy. It’s sometimes fucking difficult. It wouldn’t be a degree if it wasn’t of equal value with anyone else’s.  Or they think that I won’t have an interest in the topic at hand. Or, the very, very worst thing that happens: my opinion is disregarded, has no weight. I am not an expert, but I’m not an idiot either. I won’t speak unless I’m pretty sure that what I say is right or is valid, so assume that it is both. At least give me a chance.

This isn’t everyone’s opinion. Not by a long way, really. Most of my closer friends see that all of subjects and interests are different but are of equal value. My darling in particular sees that there is no real rift between arts and scientists. The way we work is to, you know, ask each other questions about the bits we don’t quite get, but assume that each is as smart as the other, and to give our areas of interest equal time. We don’t split our chats between science and art. It’s just stuff, all talked about mixed up together and overlapping, because that’s what real life is like.

So follow our shining example, dear reader. This divide is artificial and bloody annoying. Different subjects may indeed be employing different skills and emphasising different ways of thinking, but there is not ‘the artist’ and ‘the scientist’, separate, segregated. There is, basically, just people and stuff.
