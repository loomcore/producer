After taking some time this morning to reflect on how generally wonderful life is, I came up with the following list (not exhaustive) of things that make me very, very happy:

- Lying in bed with him listening to the shower running and the people outside and feeling that nothing else in the world matters at all
- Brussels pate on hot toast
- The scene as you come to the crest of the Tit Hall Bridge where all the architecture is mixed up and you can see it all at once
- Being outside on a clear, winter evening, all wrapped up and gazing at the stars
- A full bookcase
- The breathtaking blue of his eyes
- Every inch of him and every word he says and everything he does in general
- The feeling of shaved legs in jeans
- Cheese and onion crisps
- The ducks in the meadow flowers as you walk through Kings
- The snap as you break a KitKat in half
- A tidy room
- A finished essay (even if it’s rubbish)
- Sausages
- Driving up to and through the Bristol area on the National Express coach
- When comedians switch from being silly and funny to being deep and philosophical
- Looking at a big tree and feeling like you’re seeing through time
- Queen Elizabeth I’s ring that held a portrait of her mother
- Leonardo da Vinci’s fingerprints in his paintings
- Slightly melted cubes of jelly
- Photographs
- Non-stick saucepans
- Toffee apple cider
- Knowing that even though they’re hundreds of miles away, I’ve got family always there for me
- All the little things we often forget to love
- Life. In general.
