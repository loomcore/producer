First post in a long time, having been sans interweb for a couple of weeks. While during the first week, I didn’t miss it (being otherwise occupied), the second, when I’ve been at home ‘working’, I’ve not known what to do with myself. It’s kind of sad how much I have come to rely on the internet for everything, including keeping in touch with friends…but it’s back now, so I don’t need to change, do I? All is again well.

It took me a long time to decide on a topic on which to write. I wanted to gush a bit with an examination of my idea of love; then, having watched Louis Theroux’s latest documentary, I wanted to rant about the general stupidity and gullibility of humanity. There were hundreds of possibilities, which then led to a decision: I am going to write about uncertainty.

This shall be quite a personal post about the fact that I am an insecure and uncertain person. About everything, but particularly about my relationships and my future. This seems a stupid thing to say: who isn’t unsure about what other people are thinking, or about where there lives are going. This is the human condition. But when it becomes all you think about, it’s probably fair to state this as a fact about yourself.

How are you supposed to not worry about your relationships when you can never actually know what another person is thinking or feeling? This is my fundamental problem: you can say whatever you have to in a given situation, but what’s going on behind the smiles? How do you know where you stand, how people really feel?

Obviously, the answer is that you trust them. You know them, and, based on past behaviour, you assume that they are not lying to you. But the problem is, in my experience, people let you down. Not deliberately, not regularly, but often. And mostly not in big ways. I think that’s a problem too: everything for me is a massive deal. Someone takes an hour to text back, they tell you they can’t come over for what seems a pretty lame reason, they laugh with someone else, they don’t want to speak to you as soon as they wake up. All the end of the world. Because how can you know that it won’t happen again, that they’re not doing something more exciting, that they’re not going to dwell on that other person? It’s all terrifying. 

I don’t know from where this uncertainty about people came, or why I feel the need to obsess about being the only thing people think about, which is, I think, what would solve this problem. I don’t think it’s an ego thing, it’s not to make me feel big. It is, I think, because I always feel that unless I’m number one, I may as well not be in the running at all.

Which leads me to my second sort of uncertainty. What the hell is going to happen in just over a year’s time when I’m released into the world without a single clue about what to do, let alone a plan? I always had big hopes and ambitions. I wanted to change the world, and always thought I would do so. But now I’m not so sure. How do you go about changing the world? How do you go about changing the world when you’re not even good at anything? No talent, no ambitions left. 

What sucks is that in the environment in which I mostly reside (i.e. university), it doesn’t seem enough. Everyone surrounds you achieving or aiming to; those closest to you are super successful, which is amazing and you’re so proud and so happy, but underneath it is seething, awful jealousy. And, worse, paralysing fear: what if they carry on and leave you behind and forget you, and you’re left all alone…

I know these thoughts are irrational. If you feel the need to cart me away to an institution, make it a nice one, yeah? I don’t feel like this all the time, fear not. My big question is just about how you overcome these awful ideas. This is an answer for which I have been searching for many, many years, and, as I am right now, I’m nowhere near finding it.
