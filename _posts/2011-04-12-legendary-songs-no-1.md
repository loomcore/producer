Don't you love it when you hear a song and know that you're going to love it forever? Songs that you wish you'd written and would like to think that you probably could have just because they're so you? Is that just me? I am going to make something of a list of them through the blog. Listen to them. They're good for you.

So, my first two are going to be:

<a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4koJwex84ubpkFglJdvixe">Scissor Sisters – Something Like This</a> and <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/2hxUXmRSmw0bfQbHGaHls1">Scissor Sisters – Skin Tight</a> from 'Night Work'

But listen to the whole album. Seriously awesome.
