<p>So I've decided to start and actually maintain a blog now.  Hopefully this will suffice as a space in which to record my thoughts, feelings and opinions on a variety of dull and uninteresting topics including, but not limited to:-</p>

<p></p>

<div id="list" style="margin-left:2em;">
<ul>
        <li>Shelves,</li>
        <li>Cardboard,</li>
        <li>Stationery,</li>
        <li>Screws,</li>
        <li>And all things beige.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p></p>

<p>If you don't already know who I am, or even if you do and feel like having a bit of a self-satisfied chuckle about it, head on over to the <a href="http://yeel.es/about/">About</a> section for some background.  Essentially, I'm a sound designer and computer scientist, so those topics are pretty likely to the primary focus of this blog.  So enjoy; I promise I'll generate some real content soon.  Honest.  For now, here's Beyonc√©'s sister Solange's bootleg of Boards of Canada's excellent <i>Left Side Drive</i>, which I personally can't get enough of, though I'm sure many would argue that lyrics + BoC is sacrilege.</p>
