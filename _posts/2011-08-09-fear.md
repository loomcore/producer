It's in these strange and stormy days,
Alone, in the dark, in your mind,
That you will call on something
So deliberately left behind.
And you hope there's someone greater
Watching every beat of his heart,
Listening to my desperate pleas
While we're far apart.
Sir, I know I've not been faithful
But I would owe my life...
Please, God, if you're out there
Keep him safe tonight.
And I hope that someone hears me
Because I'm really quite afraid
And I pray someone can protect him
Despite all I have said.
And I'm not sure there's anyone to listen,
And I don't know why it's whispered aloud,
And I don't know who I appeal to,
But I trust them keep back the crowd.
