OK, I'll admit it.  Starting this blog shortly before my exams was a piss-poor idea.  But now they're over, I'll try to stick to this properly.  I promise.  Really.

Anyway, now that that's out of the way, the exciting news is now that I'm back in London I'm able to start writing tracks seriously again; indeed, I have just released a new one, in reponse to the first track in <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/colby-keating">DJ Caustic</a>'s 'Mix Wars' series, 'Dip Watch'.  My version is called 'Dipshit', and is available right <a href="http://snd.sc/meI4qs">here, right now.
