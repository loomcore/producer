To be honest, I never thought I'd be writing this post.  Having been introduced to functional programming at the start of my degree, I absolutely hated it.  ML (namely <a href="http://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html">Moscow ML</a>) is the freshers' teaching language of choice at Cambridge, and God only knows why - having had very little experience in both programming and discrete maths before, I found ML to be endlessly confusing, especially as it was the first thing we were required to learn upon arrival.  When we finally moved on to a "real" language, namely Java, suddenly everything became so much clearer, and I swore never to look back to those dark days.

Or so I thought.  Having had numerous opportunities to learn more about computation theory, discrete maths, logic and so on, I now find myself returning to the idea of functional programming, preparing for my dissertation next year.  One language in particular that has caught my eye is <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>, a JVM implementation of Lisp created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey">Rich Hickey</a> focussing on multithreaded programming and Java interoperability.  My first reaction to this was, as is only natural for the Lisp uninitiate, "ugh, brackets," coupled with the previously-mentioned bad memories of ML.  However, I found myself unable to get the idea off my mind - a JVM Lisp was intriguing, and I realised that I should probably stop limiting myself by avoiding functional programming.  In addition to this, I was fortunate enough to take part in a study for another Catabrigian's Masters project, testing an Android application, 'Soundcodr', that interpreted shapes drawn on a whiteboard as musical notation, allowing the user to invent their own method of writing music.  This inspirational project is based on <a href="http://sam.aaron.name">Sam Aaron</a>'s <a href="http://project-overtone.org/">Overtone</a> project, a Clojure-based audio environment using the SuperCollider synth server, intended for use in sound design and live coding.  It was these projects in particular that opened my eyes to the possibilities of both functional programming and Lisp;
