*Nico*, my Part II project, is coming along very nicely, and if you've been following my progress on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/loomcore/nico), you may have noticed that I have decided to license it under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).  Whilst I am aware of the ire that the GPL draws in some circles within the FLOSS community, I found that it served my needs quite neatly.  In this post I will outline the alternatives that I considered and why I turned them down, before discussing the merits and disadvantages of my final choice.

Why Not Proprietary?
--------------------
No.

* Proprietary software etc.

lol

* Access to educational software should not be restricted

Of all the institutions to fleece, it does seem ever-so-slightly evil to target schools: in my experience, educational software is often overpriced and underdeveloped.  Even when the product is good, it is easy for schools to fall into the trap of paying for a piece of software and never using it; certainly this has been the case at many of the schools I have attended or worked at. <!--not happy with this-->

I feel strongly that the schism created between schools by funding (or lack thereof) is shameful.  The fact that one can pay more money, either to move to another area or to send one's chlidren to a private school, for a "better" education is truly disgraceful.  The right to education is universal: how can we justify, as a nation, the existence of institutions specifically designed to advantage the advantaged and widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots (you may have inferred that my opinions on private healthcare are somewhat similar)?  Whilst it may seem slightly presumptuous for me to write as if *Nico* will be widely adopted, my point stands with regard to restrictions on access to education, and, by extension, educational resources.  Consequently, I have applied a free license to my project, allowing those who would benefit from it to do so.

* Counter to the intentions of the project

As *Nico* is a piece of educational software, releasing it under a non-free license would go against my motivations for choosing this project in the first place.  Although *Nico* is targeted at young learners of mathematics, to keep it closed would be to deny an educational resource to other developers interested in any of the aspects of the project (indeed, one of my reasons for writing it was to learn about Clojure): users could be Clojure learners, or interested in educational software, or just curious.  They may even want to commit improvements.  It would be somewhat hypocritical to allow the project to benefit one group of learners but not another.
